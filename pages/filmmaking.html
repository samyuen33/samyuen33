<p data-aos="fade-up">I developed my love and appreciation for the cinematic art form from watching a lot of movies growing up. The very first video I put together in middle school made me realize how much I enjoyed the process of content creation and I had been slowly learning more and more since. This love for film eventually sparked my passions for <a class="links" href="photography.html">photography</a> and music videos, as some of my favorite directors have razor-sharp focus on editing and have also worked with my favorite cinematographers.</p>
	<br>
<p data-aos="fade-up">Because I never took any TV media classes in high school, I always took every opportunity I came across to make a video, most of which were from class projects that allowed video submissions. For every new video I make, I always make sure to incorporate a new technique or idea into the process of crafting it to make sure I learned something that I wouldn’t have if it wasn’t for the video. I also surf around the web to check out new editing software that might make certain processes more convenient for me. When I’m brainstorming for a music video, I listen to a song during my walk and choreograph the editing in my head in a way that cuts to the beat. When I find a music video that utilizes visual storytelling techniques, I take note them and analyze how they condense a scenario or a narrative into a 3-minute long video. After watching a film or TV show I love, I look around for video essays on YouTube to deepen my understanding of it and appreciate it more. For fancy in-camera techniques, I watch tutorials on how to pull them off in case I find an opportunity to incorporate them in future videos. </p>

<p data-aos="fade-up">I am deeply grateful for every opportunity I get to work on a new project. Each one not only excites my creativity but the filmmaking process is always a good way for me to improve my planning and leadership skills. I also want to give a shout-out to everyone who has ever worked with me for spending their time to help bring my imagination to life. </p>
