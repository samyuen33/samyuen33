	<p data-aos="fade-up">If you want to start learning how to code, I recommend Python as your first language! Here is the first video of CS Dojo's Intro to Python playlist. I went through the whole playlist before taking my intro Python class in college and it helped a ton! The playlist covers variable, if/else statements, basic functions, list, loops, dictionaries, and classes/objects. The channel also has tutorials for numerous other coding languages and concepts. Easily one of my favorite YouTube channels for learning how to code.</p>

	<p data-aos="fade-up">If you are interested in learning mental health and psychology, I recommend Psych2Go! Their mission is to make learning everyday psychology more accessible and they produce short, digestable animated videos about subjects that you can apply and relate to. My favorite videos from them are about things you should say or do to help out those who suffer from certain challenges like anxiety, depression and eating disorders. I use what I learn from those videos to help out others around me in need of it.</p>

	<p data-aos="fade-up">If you are interested in career and business tips, I recommend going on Ladders! The website is a job search site but it also has its own resume review tools and articles about interview tips, personal finance, health, and productivity. I mostly go on the site for career tips about resume do's and don'ts and social psychology articles about developing relationships inside and outside the workplace. To avoid their free article limit, I read their articles through the Google News app on my phone. </p>

	<p data-aos="fade-up">For more actionable advice on interview and career tips, check out product marketer Jeff Su's channel on YouTube! His videos always go straight to the point and are very well explained. The first video from him I came across was a tutorial on how to make your LinkedIn profile look more attractive with a He also runs a Facebook group for people to get together to ask for help in their careers. Man, I wish I came across his channel sooner!</p>

	<p data-aos="fade-up">For psychological insights and confidence-boosting hacks, check out leadership coach Shade Zahrai's channel on YouTube! Just like Jeff Su's, her videos are very straight-forward and some are even just a minute long. Her channel seems like it's targeted towards women but her advice can really apply to anyone. My favorite video on her channel is on how to stay motivated, which is so much more important to watch in the age of the pandemic. </p>
