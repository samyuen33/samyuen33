<p data-aos="fade-up">Out of all the episodes of Black Mirror, “Be Right Back” has always struck me the hardest for diving into the universal theme of grief and serving as a firm reminder that the flaws of humanity will always be too much for technology to alleviate, no matter the leaps and bounds it can make. Even the sci-fi elements of the episode showcases the perfect forms of the kind of technology I want to be involved in after I graduate: the replication of someone’s presence when they’re not really there.</p>

<p data-aos="fade-up">The episode begins with the introduction of the main character, Martha, and her boyfriend, Ash. It’s a normal night that shows off the normality and casual joys of the two in a loving relationship. They happily sing together in a car ride back home then Martha discovers something personal about Ash’s mother when the two talk about a photo of Ash’s brother. According to Ash, his mother dealt with grief by hiding the photos and belongings of her loved ones in the attic. I loved this short conversation for what it foreshadows. </p>
	<br>
	
<p data-aos="fade-up">My absolute favorite scene begins with the next day. Martha worries about Ash for missing her calls and not contacting her at all throughout the day while he’s out driving somewhere. She calls her sister about it at night. As her sister tells her not to worry, we see flashes of red and blue on Martha’s face, coming directly from outside the house. It’s a simple and extremely effective visual gut punch because it’s something we’ve all seen before but more importantly, something we all want to avoid in our lives. No dialogue necessary. No doubt about what has happened.</p>

	<br>
<p data-aos="fade-up">At the funeral, Martha’s friend recommends her to sign up for a program that would “help” Key word there. Her friend later signs up for her and Martha is greeted by a text message from an AI calling itself “Ash” The speech pattern of the AI is only based on the public comments that the real Ash made on the internet so Martha feeds it all the videos and photos she has of him to enhance the likeness of AI Ash. This moment is interesting to me because this is where we see the most advanced and perfect form of machine learning for natural language processing do its thing. Moments later, AI Ash calls her and Martha notes it sounds exactly like him and is saying exactly the things Ash would say. The speech synthesis sounds perfect. </p>

	<br>
<p data-aos="fade-up">Some time passes to show how Ash lives through their phone calls. Martha seems to talk to it just as often as she would if he was still alive. It doesn’t seem healthy to me because it looked like Martha has been relying on the AI as a crutch to avoid her grief, the same way people do with drugs and alcohol. After all, the program was supposed to just “help” with the coping right? Eventually, she wants a physicality to his simulated presence so she orders an expensive mannequin that could shapeshift into him and be controlled by AI Ash. This reminded me of how people would tell themselves they would give anything, whether it’s money, belonging, career, to get their loved ones back or turn back time. The mannequin works well but it only satisfies her for a brief period. She sees details from AI Ash in his behavior that remind her he’s only a robot: absolutely obedient, incapable of physical harm, and a shadow of her dead boyfriend. Martha tries to provoke AI Ash by hitting him and yelling at him just to get any kind of emotional reaction, anything definitively human from him. Later she decides she doesn’t want him anymore so she tries to tell him to jump off a cliff and destroy itself. This plans fails as soon as she mentions the real Ash wouldn’t willingly jump off. AI Ash quickly adds this bit of information into his algorithm and begs for his life. Martha realizes even that kind of behavior would be fake and screams in frustration into the distance.</p>

	<br>
<p data-aos="fade-up">Years pass and Martha’s daughter asks her mother for permission to go hang out in the attic for her birthday. She also invites Martha join her for cake. The episode concludes with Martha hesitating then reluctantly climbing up to the attic, where AI Ash and Ash’s belongings are. 
No matter how well technology can replicate human presence, it doesn’t make navigating the loss of a loved one any easier.</p>
